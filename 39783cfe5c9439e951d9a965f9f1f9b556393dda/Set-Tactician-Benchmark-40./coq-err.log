without specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It
is recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes

"#[export] Hint Rewrite foo : bar." This is supported since Coq 8.14.

Warning: The default value for rewriting hint locality is currently "local"
in a section and "global" otherwise, but is scheduled to change in a future
release. For the time being, adding rewriting hints outside of sections
without specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It
is recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes
#[local], #[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example:
"#[export] Hint Rewrite foo : bar." This is supported since Coq 8.14.

non forgetful inheritance detected.
 You have two solutions: 
1. (Best practice) Reorganize your hierarchy to make 
isConvexSpace__isConvexSpace depend on NaryConvexSpace_NaryConv. 
See the paper "Competing inheritance paths in 
dependent type theory" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336) for more 
explanations 
2. Use the attribute #[non_forgetful_inheritance] to disable this check. 
We strongly advise you encapsulate this instance inside a module, 
in order to isolate it from the rest of the code, and to be able 
to import it on demand. See the above paper and the file 
https://github.com/math-comp/hierarchy-builder/blob/master/tests/non_forgetful_inheritance.v 
to witness devastating effects.
