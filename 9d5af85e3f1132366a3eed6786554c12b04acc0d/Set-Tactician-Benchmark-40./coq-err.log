Warning: The default value for instance locality is currently "local" in a
section and "global" otherwise, but is scheduled to change in a future
release. For the time being, adding instances outside of sections without
specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It is
recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes #[local],
#[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example: "#[export]
Instance Foo : Bar := baz." [deprecated-instance-without-locality,deprecated]
