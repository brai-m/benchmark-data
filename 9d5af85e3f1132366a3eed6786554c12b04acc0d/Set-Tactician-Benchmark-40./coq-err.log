non forgetful inheritance detected.
 You have two solutions: 
1. (Best practice) Reorganize your hierarchy to make category_isMonad 
depend on category_Functor. See the paper "Competing inheritance paths in 
dependent type theory" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336) for more 
explanations 
2. Use the attribute #[non_forgetful_inheritance] to disable this check. 
We strongly advise you encapsulate this instance inside a module, 
in order to isolate it from the rest of the code, and to be able 
to import it on demand. See the above paper and the file 
https://github.com/math-comp/hierarchy-builder/blob/master/tests/non-forgetful-inheritance.v 
to witness devastating effects.

non forgetful inheritance detected.
 You have two solutions: 
1. (Best practice) Reorganize your hierarchy to make category_isMonad 
depend on category_Functor. See the paper "Competing inheritance paths in 
dependent type theory" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336) for more 
explanations 
2. Use the attribute #[non_forgetful_inheritance] to disable this check. 
We strongly advise you encapsulate this instance inside a module, 
in order to isolate it from the rest of the code, and to be able 
to import it on demand. See the above paper and the file 
https://github.com/math-comp/hierarchy-builder/blob/master/tests/non-forgetful-inheritance.v 
to witness devastating effects.
