  DEPRECATION: graph2tac is being installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method, because it does not have a 'pyproject.toml' and the 'wheel' package is not installed. pip 23.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to enable the '--use-pep517' option. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8559

[notice] A new release of pip is available: 23.0.1 -> 23.1.2
[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
[NOTE] Package coq-tactician-stdlib is already installed (current version is 8.11.dev).
