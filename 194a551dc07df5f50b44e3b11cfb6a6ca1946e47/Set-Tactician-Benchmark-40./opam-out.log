The following system packages will first need to be installed:

Let opam run your package manager to install the required system packages?
(answer 'n' for other options) [Y/n] n
These commands should get the requirements installed:

    yum install epel-release
    yum install capnproto capnproto-devel
    rpm -q --whatprovides capnproto capnproto-devel epel-release

You can retry with '--assume-depexts' to skip this check, or run 'opam option
depext=false' to permanently disable handling of system packages altogether.
