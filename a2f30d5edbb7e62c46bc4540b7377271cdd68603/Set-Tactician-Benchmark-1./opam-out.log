                                           This package will overwrite Coq's standard library files.
                                           A backup of the original files will be placed under Coq's
                                           library directory at user-contrib/tactician-stdlib-backup/
                                           and they will be restored when you remove this package.
                                           After installation of this package, all other Coq packages
                                           also need to be recompiled. Running the 'tactician recompile'
                                           command-line utility will help with this process.
