Warning: The default value for hint locality is currently "local" in a
section and "global" otherwise, but is scheduled to change in a future
release. For the time being, adding hints outside of sections without
specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It is
recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes #[local],
#[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example: "#[export]
Hint Unfold foo : bar." [deprecated-hint-without-locality,deprecated]

Warning: The default value for rewriting hint locality is currently "local"
in a section and "global" otherwise, but is scheduled to change in a future
release. For the time being, adding rewriting hints outside of sections
without specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It
is recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes
#[local], #[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example:
"#[export] Hint Rewrite foo : bar."

Warning: The default value for rewriting hint locality is currently "local"
in a section and "global" otherwise, but is scheduled to change in a future
release. For the time being, adding rewriting hints outside of sections
without specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It
is recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes
#[local], #[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example:
"#[export] Hint Rewrite foo : bar."

non forgetful inheritance detected.
 You have two solutions: 
1. (Best practice) Reorganize your hierarchy to make category_isMonad 
depend on category_Functor. See the paper "Competing inheritance paths in 
dependent type theory" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336) for more 
explanations 
2. Use the attribute #[non_forgetful_inheritance] to disable this check. 
We strongly advise you encapsulate this instance inside a module, 
in order to isolate it from the rest of the code, and to be able 
to import it on demand. See the above paper and the file 
https://github.com/math-comp/hierarchy-builder/blob/master/tests/non-forgetful-inheritance.v 
to witness devastating effects.

non forgetful inheritance detected.
 You have two solutions: 
1. (Best practice) Reorganize your hierarchy to make category_isMonad 
depend on category_Functor. See the paper "Competing inheritance paths in 
dependent type theory" (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02463336) for more 
explanations 
2. Use the attribute #[non_forgetful_inheritance] to disable this check. 
We strongly advise you encapsulate this instance inside a module, 
in order to isolate it from the rest of the code, and to be able 
to import it on demand. See the above paper and the file 
https://github.com/math-comp/hierarchy-builder/blob/master/tests/non-forgetful-inheritance.v 
to witness devastating effects.
