#[local], #[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example:
"#[export] Hint Rewrite foo : bar." This is supported since Coq 8.14.

Warning: The default value for rewriting hint locality is currently "local"
in a section and "global" otherwise, but is scheduled to change in a future
release. For the time being, adding rewriting hints outside of sections
without specifying an explicit locality attribute is therefore deprecated. It
is recommended to use "export" whenever possible. Use the attributes
#[local], #[global] and #[export] depending on your choice. For example:
"#[export] Hint Rewrite foo : bar." This is supported since Coq 8.14.
