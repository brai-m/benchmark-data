This version of opam requires an update to the layout of /home/lasse/Documents/Projects/Tactician/benchmark-system/tmp-scratch/opam-root from version 2.1 to version 2.2, which can't be reverted.
You may want to back it up before going further.

[NOTE] The 'jobs' option was reset, its value was 1 and its new value will vary according to the current number of cores on your machine. You can restore the fixed value using:
           opam option jobs=1 --global
